*(This is a work in progress)*

Maybe one day I will be able to build a 'full' RISC-V core...

For the student finding this:

Please make sure to follow relevant lab assignment rules when using this code.
Plagarism and cheating is always unacceptable. RIScarlet being available as free
software does not mean you can ignore other rules and evade responsibility.
